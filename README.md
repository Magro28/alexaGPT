Just some snippets for an Alexa skill which connects to OpenAI GPT API

I implemented a simple memory function (stores the last 20 conversations) and should remember these until the lambda function restarts. Just up the value if you like in the add_message_to_history function.

## How to setup

Just go to developer.amazon.com -> Alexa and build a skill from scratch and use the python environment. Choose the right locale. 
#### Build section

##### Invocations
Set the invocation name 

##### Interaction Model
###### Json File
Change the intents and invocation name in the intents.json file and put the json file there. 

Build the model.

#### Code section
Replace in the code section the lambda_function.py and requirement.txt.

Also add your open ai API KEY from platform.openai.com in the code and change the prompt description to your likes.

Deploy the code.

#### Test section
In the "Test" tab set skill testing to "development". It should now run on your Alexa device.
